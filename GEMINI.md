### 2025-09-07 - Initial Project Analysis & Setup

- **Decision/Logic:** This is the initial entry in our shared memory file. I have analyzed the existing codebase to understand its architecture and current state. The project is a Tauri desktop application using SvelteKit for the frontend. State management is being handled directly within Svelte components using Svelte 5 Runes (`$state`), which is why the mentioned `stores.ts` file was not found. The core of the application is a block-based editor, similar in concept to Notion.

- **Key Architectural Points:**
    - **Frontend:** SvelteKit with TypeScript. Components use Svelte 5 Runes for reactive state management.
    - **Styling:** A dark theme inspired by Notion is implemented in `app.css`.
    - **Layout (`+layout.svelte`):** Manages a persistent sidebar that can be pinned or automatically hidden.
    - **Editor (`Editor.svelte`):** Manages a document as an array of `Block` objects. It currently supports adding new paragraph blocks by pressing "Enter".
    - **Data Structure (`types.ts`):** The `Block` type is the fundamental unit of content, with `id`, `type`, `content`, and an optional `autofocus` property.

- **Files Analyzed:**
    - `src/routes/+layout.svelte`
    - `src/routes/+page.svelte`
    - `src/lib/components/Editor.svelte`
    - `src/lib/components/Sidebar.svelte`
    - `src/lib/types.ts`

- **Pr√≥ximo Passo Sugerido:** Implement the "delete block" functionality as planned.
